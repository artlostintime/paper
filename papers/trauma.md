# Post-Traumatic Growth in First Responders

_Principal Investigator • In Development_

Mixed-methods study on factors facilitating growth following occupational trauma exposure ($N=167$).

Growth trajectory modeled as:

$$G(t) = G_{max} \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda t})$$

Where $\lambda$ represents individual resilience factor and $t$ is time since trauma.

Social support emerged as the **strongest predictor** ($\beta = 0.48$) of post-traumatic growth.
