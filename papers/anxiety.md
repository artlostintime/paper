_Co-Author • Published 2024_

Heartbeat detection paradigm examining interoceptive accuracy in panic patients ($N=89$).

Interoceptive accuracy:

$$IA = 1 - \frac{|HB_{actual} - HB_{reported}|}{HB_{actual}}$$

Panic disorder patients showed **significantly higher** interoceptive sensitivity ($IA = 0.78$) compared to controls ($IA = 0.61$).
