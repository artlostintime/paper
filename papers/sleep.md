# Sleep Quality & Emotional Regulation

_Co-Investigator • Under Review_

Investigating bidirectional relationships between sleep disturbance and emotion dysregulation ($N=198$).

Sleep efficiency calculated as:

$$SE = \frac{TST}{TIB} \times 100\%$$

Where $TST$ = Total Sleep Time and $TIB$ = Time In Bed.

Poor sleepers showed **2.3x higher** rates of emotional dysregulation on the DERS scale.
