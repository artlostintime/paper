_Co-Investigator • Published 2023_

Cross-sectional analysis of personality trait trajectories from ages 18-80 ($N=2,847$).

Trait stability coefficient:

$$\rho_{xy} = \frac{Cov(X_t, X_{t+k})}{\sigma_{X_t} \cdot \sigma_{X_{t+k}}}$$

**Conscientiousness** showed the largest increase with age ($d = 0.54$), while **Neuroticism** decreased ($d = -0.38$).
