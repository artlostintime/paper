# Social Media Use & Adolescent Well-Being

_Research Assistant • Under Review_

Ecological momentary assessment of social media effects on mood ($N=412$, ages 13-18).

Well-being impact score:

$$WIS = \beta_0 + \beta_1(passive) + \beta_2(active) + \beta_3(duration) + \epsilon$$

**Passive consumption** was associated with decreased well-being ($\beta = -0.31$), while active engagement showed no significant effect.
