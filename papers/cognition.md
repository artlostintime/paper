# Working Memory & Decision-Making Under Stress

_Co-Investigator • Published 2024_

Examined how acute stress affects working memory capacity and subsequent decision quality in clinical settings ($N=124$).

The cognitive load was measured using:

$$CL = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} T_i \cdot D_i}{W_{max}}$$

Where $T_i$ represents task complexity, $D_i$ is duration, and $W_{max}$ is maximum working memory capacity.

Results showed a **23% decrease** in decision accuracy under high-stress conditions (p < 0.01).
