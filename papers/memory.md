# False Memory Formation in Eyewitness Testimony

_Co-Author • Published 2024_

Experimental study on misinformation effects in simulated crime scenarios ($N=203$).

Memory accuracy decay:

$$A(t) = A_0 \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} + M_{interference}$$

Where $\tau$ is the decay constant and $M_{interference}$ represents post-event misinformation.

**Leading questions** increased false memory rates by 340% compared to neutral prompts (p < 0.001).
