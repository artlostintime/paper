# Neural Correlates of Empathy in Healthcare Providers

_Research Assistant • Published 2023_

fMRI study examining activation patterns in the anterior insula and ACC during empathic responses ($N=48$).

BOLD signal change calculated as:

$$\Delta S = \frac{S_{task} - S_{baseline}}{S_{baseline}} \times 100\%$$

Identified significant activation clusters in the **mirror neuron system** (p < 0.001, FWE corrected).

Healthcare providers with higher empathy scores showed 31% greater activation in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ).
