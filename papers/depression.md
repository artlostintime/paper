# Rumination Patterns in Major Depressive Disorder

_Lead Author • In Press_

Experience sampling study tracking real-time rumination in MDD patients ($N=134$).

Rumination intensity index:

$$RI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{f_i \cdot d_i \cdot v_i}{n}$$

Where $f$ = frequency, $d$ = duration, and $v$ = valence of ruminative episodes.

Participants reporting **>3 hours daily rumination** showed 4x slower treatment response rates.
