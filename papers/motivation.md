# Intrinsic Motivation in Academic Achievement

_Lead Author • Under Review_

Investigating the relationship between intrinsic motivation and long-term academic success across diverse student populations ($N=312$).

We model motivation using Self-Determination Theory:

$$M_{total} = \alpha \cdot M_{intrinsic} + \beta \cdot M_{extrinsic} + \gamma \cdot M_{amotivation}$$

Where coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ represent weighted contributions to overall motivational orientation.

Preliminary findings suggest **intrinsic motivation** accounts for 47% of variance in GPA when controlling for socioeconomic factors.
