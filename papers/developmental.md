# Executive Function Development in Early Childhood

_Principal Investigator • In Development_

Longitudinal study tracking inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility ages 3-7 ($N=178$).

Composite EF score:

$$EF_{composite} = \frac{z_{IC} + z_{WM} + z_{CF}}{3}$$

Where $z$ scores represent standardized performance on each EF component.

Children showing **early EF gains** (top quartile at age 4) maintained advantages through kindergarten readiness assessments.
