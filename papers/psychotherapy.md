# Efficacy of CBT vs. Mindfulness-Based Interventions

_Co-Author • In Press_

Randomized controlled trial comparing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and MBSR for anxiety disorders ($N=156$).

Effect size calculated using Cohen's d:

$$d = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{S_{pooled}}$$

Where $S_{pooled} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)S_1^2 + (n_2-1)S_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}$

Both interventions showed significant symptom reduction, with CBT showing **d = 0.82** and MBSR showing **d = 0.71** at 12-week follow-up.
