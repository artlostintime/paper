Developing mixed-methods protocol (Target $N=180$) to identify protective relational factors against burnout.

We calculate the correlation coefficient using:

$$r = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

This study utilizes the Maslach Burnout Inventory (**MBI-HSS**).
